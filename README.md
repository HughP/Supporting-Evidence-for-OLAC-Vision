# Supporting-Evidence-for-OLAC-Vision

This repo contains the following files:

* Two image files of the same image but different resolutions (created in figma).
* The data in a CSV format which is the basis of the image and for data presented in the linked presentation.

While conducting this analysis it became apparent that there were several clades of providers which developed. By clade I mean a group of data providers which evolved together sharing an exposure to OLAC metadata and a technologist. Those clades are indicated in this image. The indicated clades are to be treated as suspect, but I think there is reason to believe that there is a great amount of sociological influence which permits these clades to form. For example, I know that at one time Gary Simons assisted AILLIA with their OLAC feed, so perhaps that archive might belong in a common clade with the entities within the SIL clade. If that is the case then maybe the SIL clade ought to be renamed as the Gary Simons clade. I also suspect there might be a CLARIN clade, but I don't know for sure or how these relationships are or were structured. I also suspect that there might be or was an Australian clade in which [Nick Thieberger](https://nthieberger.net/) would have been influential. If this is the case then the Hawaii clade may be suspect and rather than two clades (Hawaii and Australia) there may only be one which would include those entities assisted or guided by Professor Thieberger.

The image is incomplete with regard to the total number of data providers. It lacks the following data providers which were left out for visual space constraint reasons (and no other reason). Their data does remain in the CSV file.

* IULA UPF OAI Archive
* ODIN - The Online Database of Interlinear Text
* Cornell Language Acquisition Lab
* Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages
